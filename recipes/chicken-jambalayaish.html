  <h3>A quick note</h3>
  <p>
    I’m not a trained or qualified chef. I’ve never worked in a professional kitchen,
    and my presentation still needs work. This site exists because I’m on a learning
    journey — cooking, tasting, screwing things up, fixing them, and trying to get
    better over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    What I <em>do</em> take seriously is understanding <strong>why</strong> things work,
    not just following steps. If something here sounds over-analysed, that’s deliberate.
    It’s me writing down what I’ve learnt so future-me (and maybe you) can repeat the
    good bits and avoid the mistakes.

            Dice all veg as listed. From the black pudding, slice <strong>most</strong> into small thin chunks.
            Reserve a small portion and slice it into <strong>the thinnest strips you can manage without breaking</strong>.
            Get everything laid out before turning the heat on.
          </p>
          <details class="why">
            <summary>Why?</summary>
            <p>
              This dish has short windows where hesitation ruins things: aromatics bloom fast, chicken goes rubbery if you overdo it,
              and rice hydration is unforgiving. Prep first means you’re executing, not reacting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Splitting the black pudding gives you two different textural roles:
              chunky bits to fold through for savoury depth across the whole dish,
              and ultra-thin strips that can crisp hard and survive as a garnish.
              Treat it all the same and you either lose crunch or lose distribution.
            </p>

          <p>
            Fry all the black pudding pieces in a little oil over medium heat until crisp.
            Remove to a plate. <strong>Separate the ultra-thin strips</strong> and keep them pristine for garnish.
            Keep the fat in the pan.
          </p>
          <details class="why">
            <summary>Why?</summary>
            <p>
              Rendering black pudding early gives you a fat rich in savoury compounds that seasons everything cooked in it afterwards.
              That’s deeper than “add more salt later”.
            </p>
            <p>
              The chunkier pieces can be folded through the rice later for distribution.
              The ultra-thin strips crisp harder and faster — keeping them separate preserves a brittle crunch you can’t recover once they soften.

              This stage removes harsh raw flavours and replaces them with sweetness and body.
              If you rush it, the finished dish always tastes slightly unfinished.

            <p>
              Garlic and paprika bloom quickly but burn even quicker. This brief window extracts flavour without bitterness.
              If it smells acrid, you’ve gone too far.

            <p>
              Sealing firms the outside so the chicken survives simmering without going woolly.
              You’re setting texture, not chasing colour.

            <summary>Why?</summary>
            <p>
              Basmati gives you defined grains and a cleaner finish. Coating it in fat delays starch release;
              gentle heat gives even hydration instead of gluey porridge.

              Late chillies keep a brighter top-note. Add them early and you cook away the interesting flavour,
              leaving only blunt heat.

            Take the egg you froze overnight out of the freezer. Crack and peel it.
            <strong>Run it under the cold tap while peeling</strong> to help the shell come away cleanly.
            Slice into rounds, then fry gently in a little oil/butter until set. Reserve for plating.
          </p>
          <details class="why">
            <summary>Why?</summary>
            <p>
              Freezing isn’t for drama — it’s for control. A normal fried egg gives you one yolk blob and loads of white,
              which is annoying when you want yolk distributed across a bowl.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frozen egg becomes sliceable. Frying discs gives you “mini fried eggs”: yolk and white in each slice,
              so every bite can get a bit of yolk without needing two eggs and ending up drowning in white.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cold tap helps the shell separate from the frozen albumen so you don’t tear chunks out of it and ruin the slices.

            Off the heat, stir in butter and <strong>white wine vinegar</strong>. Add a <strong>small squeeze of lemon juice</strong>.
            Taste and adjust seasoning.
            Fold the <strong>chunky</strong> black pudding pieces through the rice.
            Plate, top with the mini egg slices, then finish with the <strong>ultra-crispy black pudding strips</strong> and a
            <strong>sprinkle of lemon zest</strong>.
          </p>
          <details class="why">
            <summary>Why?</summary>
            <p>
              Butter rounds and emulsifies; vinegar lifts. The tiny squeeze of lemon juice is an extra “fresh top note” that reads as brightness,
              not as “lemony”. It should make you go “oh nice” rather than “that’s lemon”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Folding chunky black pudding through distributes savoury depth across the whole dish. Keeping the thinnest strips for garnish preserves
              brittle crunch — that contrast is what stops this becoming a single-texture beige bowl.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lemon zest is aroma, not acidity. It hits your nose first, which makes the whole dish feel brighter without watering it down.
